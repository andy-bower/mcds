2014-03-14  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding more debug info and correcting for \r's.
	Adding a debug section in the xml parsing.
	It seems owncloud/sabredav encode the \r's which libxml converts
	back to \r's so in the vcard regex/printing we should check to
	make sure they are not the second to last character, if they are
	we remove them.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://code.freeshell.org/mcds

	Split the parsing into xml and regex.
	Decided to bite the bullet and use libxml to do the initial parsing
	of the carddav data received. Then when a vcard is found, pass it
	off to a regex parser.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Upping the revision number.

	Updated the output to conform to mutt.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding the ability to print the full name.
	The mutt query command expects the results along the lines of:
		Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
		me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
		blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
		roessler@guug.de        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp

	That is a one line message, then each matching response on a
	single line, each line containing a tab separated address then
	name then some other optional information. On error, or if there
	are no matching addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a
	one line error message.
